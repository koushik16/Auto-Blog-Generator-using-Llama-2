# Auto-Blog-Generator-using-Llama-2
An End-to-End Blog Generator project using Streamlit, Llama-2 and huggingface API.

Before starting create user in meta.ai for using Llama chat or other models. 
I used a pre-trained Llama-2 which was open-sourced in huggingface and trined using 2 trillion tokens of data points 
This particular Llama model was trained with 7 billion parameters, which can be fine-tuned further
